                        <p>As you can see, each element on this web page is clearly defined. Everything is enveloped by
                                white
                                space. It’s predictable and pleasing to the eye. After visiting their desktop page,
                                their idea
                                of a clean look expands. In fact, the amount of white space is used to create symbolic
                                imagery,
                                like a globe with languages all around creating the idea that everyone in the world can
                                use
                                their site. In general, their page succeeds at making white space their foundation upon
                                which to
                                build upon. It’s almost as though you are walking into a crisp, and clean library full
                                of fresh
                                books.</p>

                        <p>Looking at this page, you might start want to relax, and have a movie marathon, why? This page i think use the Gestalt Principles – a Background
                            The Gestalt Principles of grouping (“Gestalt” is German for “unified whole”) represent the culmination of the work of early 20th-century German psychologists Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka and Wolfgang Kohler, who sought to understand how humans typically gain meaningful perceptions from chaotic stimuli around them. Wertheimer and company identified a set of laws addressing this natural compulsion to seek order amid disorder, where the mind “informs” what the eye sees by making sense of a series of elements as an image, or illusion. Early graphic designers soon began applying the Gestalt Principles in advertising, encapsulating company values within iconic logos. In the century since, designers have deployed Gestalt Principles extensively, crafting designs with well-placed elements that catch the eye as larger, whole images so viewers instantly make positive connections with the organizations represented. 
                            The whole is other than the sum of the parts. 
                            
                            - Kurt Koffka .</p>

                                <h4>BYU Tv</h4>

                        <p>Notice how everything has a designated place? There’s an invisible edge to the left that
                                draws your
                                eyes further and further down the page. The short paragraphs, large headings, and lack
                                of side
                                menus really create a clean, and organized look. When visiting their desktop version of
                                the
                                page, each section is still lined up, but there is more to it. The clean left edge is
                                more
                                apparent due to the fact that none of the paragraphs are indented, which is something
                                not
                                completely noticed in their mobile version. However, this is naturally pleasing to the
                                eyes.
                                Alignment is all about showing the eyes where to look, and this page does just that.</p>
